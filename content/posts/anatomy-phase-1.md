### MISSION OBJECTIVE
[cite_start]This series documents the **Anatomy of a Modern Cyber Attack**, a full-chain simulation designed to test the resilience of hybrid-cloud architectures[cite: 13, 14]. [cite_start]Through the lens of **Operation Ghost-Hydra**, we analyze a proprietary 6-tier offensive ecosystem—from initial reconnaissance to final exfiltration[cite: 14, 16].

#### Operational Scope
* [cite_start]**Objective**: Demonstrate critical vulnerabilities in modern EDR, WAF, and IAM security layers[cite: 16].
* [cite_start]**Research Focus**: Analyzing how custom-engineered Go, Rust, and Kotlin agents bypass signature-based detections[cite: 30].
* [cite_start]**Strategic Outcome**: Providing high-fidelity remediation data for Zero Trust architectures[cite: 88, 90].
