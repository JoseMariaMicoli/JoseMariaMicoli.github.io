## I. THE CORE DUALITY

### THE GHOST: OPERATOR XOCE
**STATUS:** `NON-ATTRIBUTABLE` // **OPERATIONAL PHILOSOPHY:** `CONSTANT_AGGRESSIVE_RD`

Within the noise of the wire, I am **Operator Xoce**. I am the manifestation of the **"Ghost Factor."** My approach is born from the belief that security is never a static product; it is a relentless pursuit of the invisible. 

In my [Ghost-Hydra Manifesto](/posts/manifesto), I posit that when defense builds a wall, the standard auditor looks for a crack. I do not. I study the **"chemistry of the bricks"**—the fundamental logic and binary composition of the system—to make the entire structure evaporate. I operate in the spaces between protocols, weaponizing OIDC trust and hiding inside gRPC traffic, ensuring that the tradecraft is indistinguishable from the system itself.

### THE ARCHITECT: JOSÉ MARÍA MICOLI
**REAL-WORLD ROLE:** Senior Red Team Operator & Offensive Security R&D Engineer

Behind the mask, I am a technical authority bridging the chasm between deep-tier offensive research and high-fidelity defense. With over a decade entrenched in the high-stakes financial sector (**ICBC, BANCOR, Grant Thornton**), I have mastered the industry standards not to follow them, but to transcend them.

I translate the aggressive R&D of the "Ghost" into strategic, Executive-level risk intelligence. My goal is to force the industry to move faster by building the very tools—custom C2 frameworks, reporting engines, and ransomware simulators—that reveal exactly where the Blue Team is truly blind.

## II. PROFESSIONAL EXPERIENCE: THE HYDRA PHILOSOPHY

I operate under the **"Hydra Philosophy"**: any attack with a single vector is a pre-calculated failure. My engineering focuses on **Persistence through Redundancy**. Like the mythic beast, my tradecraft is multi-headed; if a SOC severs one C2 channel, the "Ghost" remains active through secondary gRPC streams or hijacked OIDC trust. 

## III. TECHNICAL DRILL: THE 7-TOOL 4D INFILTRATION

I execute engagements through a research-driven cycle I call **4D Infiltration**:

1.  **Shadow Mapping:** Utilizing `VaporTrace` for surgical API discovery of "forgotten" endpoints.
2.  **Initial Access & Identity Hijack:** Neutralizing MFA by weaponizing OIDC trust through `Ghost-Pipeline`.
3.  **Persistence & Evasion:** Deploying `Hydra-C2` for stealthy communication and `Hydra-Worm` to automate lateral movement.
4.  **Impact & Intelligence:** Simulating the end-game with `APEX-PRO` to audit IR readiness, delivered via `VectorVue`.

## ⚙️ TECHNICAL CORE & ADVERSARIAL R&D

### 🛡️ Offensive Engineering & Adversary Emulation
* **Custom Tradecraft:** Architecting stealth agents in **Rust** and high-concurrency C2 orchestrators in **Go** to bypass EDR/XDR heuristics.
* **Temporal Evasion:** Implementing **NHPP-based stochastic jitter** and non-standard protocol tunneling (DNS, ICMP, gRPC).
* **Active Directory & Infrastructure:** On-prem AD (Kerberoasting, GPO, Bloodhound) and Azure AD identity hijacking.

### 🌐 AppSec, Web & Cloud Surface Discovery
* **API Security Research:** Specialist in Shadow API mining and **OIDC/OAuth2** trust model bypass.
* **Mobile Security:** Expert Android Pentesting and APK/SDK reverse engineering (**JADX, Ghidra**).
